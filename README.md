# EA comparison

Example evolutionary algorithms implemented using different frameworks.

The examples cover both a real-numbered problem (Rastrigin optimisation)
and a binary problem (One-Max). In each case, the same algorithm is used
across all frameworks.

## Frameworks

The tested frameworks include:

  * [Meow](https://github.com/jonatanklosko/meow)
  * [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap)
  * [LEAP](https://github.com/AureumChaos/LEAP)
  * [EASEA](https://github.com/EASEA/easea)
